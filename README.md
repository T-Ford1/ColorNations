# ColorNations

My Program is a dominaion-based color war.
It's entirely in java 1.8.

You spawn in the map and minions join you as you
acquire territory. Defeat enemy colors in order
to win the round. Arrow keys and WASD movement
control the main character, and clicking shoots
projectiles. Just know that this is a huge work-
in-progress, and the ai, movement, and balancing
still needs lots of work. Its background map was
created with a seperate program that created the
computer-generated images. I hope you find the
game funny, even with all its quirks and oddities.
